call stack is present inside the javascript engine.

example-


JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning only one task can run at a time â€” using something called the Call Stack.

But what about setTimeout and other delayed or asynchronous operations?
Thatâ€™s where the Event Loop and Web APIs come in.

console.log("start");

setTimeout(function cb() {
  console.log("timer");
}, 5000);

console.log("end");



Step-by-Step Breakdown
âœ… 1. Global Execution Context (GEC) is Created
Your code starts executing top to bottom.

console.log("start") is added to the Call Stack and executed.

Output: start

âœ… 2. setTimeout(cb, 5000) is Encountered
setTimeout is NOT part of JS itself â€” itâ€™s a Web API provided by the browser.

What happens here:

cb (the callback function) is sent to the Web API Timer.

A 5-second timer starts.

Meanwhile, JS does NOT wait. It moves to the next line.

âœ… 3. console.log("end")
Added to the Call Stack, executed.

Output: end

âœ… 4. After 5 Seconds: cb() is ready
Timer expires.

cb() is moved to the Callback Queue (a waiting line).

âœ… 5. Event Loopâ€™s Job Begins
Event loop checks:

Is the Call Stack empty?

If YES, it pushes cb() from the Callback Queue to the Call Stack.

Now cb() runs and logs:

Output: timer


| Component          | Role                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Call Stack**     | Where JS code is executed. One task at a time.                          |
| **Web APIs**       | Browser-provided tools (`setTimeout`, DOM, fetch API,localstorage, etc.)                 |
| **Callback Queue** | Holds finished async callbacks until the Call Stack is free.            |
| **Event Loop**     | Middleman that moves ready callbacks to the Call Stack when it's empty. |


output-
start
end
(timer logs after ~5 sec)
timer


In Short:
The Event Loop continuously checks if the Call Stack is empty, and if so, moves the first function from the Callback Queue into the Call Stack for execution.



2. example-

console.log("Start");

document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function cb() {
  console.log("Callback");
});

console.log("End");


Step-by-Step Explanation:
ðŸŸ© Step 1: Global Execution Context (GEC) Created
When the script runs, JavaScript creates a Global Execution Context, and starts executing top-down.

ðŸŸ© Step 2: console.log("Start")
This goes into the Call Stack

Executes immediately

ðŸ–¨ Output: Start

Then it's popped off the stack

ðŸŸ© Step 3: Event Listener Setup

document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function cb() { ... });
This line registers a callback (cb) with the Web API environment (handled by the browser).

It does not execute the callback now.

It says:

"Hey browser, if the user clicks this btn element, please call this cb function."

This is event listener registration, not execution.

So:

Nothing goes to call stack yet

The browser stores:

Element btn

Event click

Callback cb

ðŸŸ© Step 4: console.log("End")
Added to the call stack

Executes immediately

ðŸ–¨ Output: End

Then removed from the stack

ðŸ“¤ Step 5: GEC is Done
The Global Execution Context is now popped from the call stack.

But the click event listener remains alive in the Web API environment.

Why? Because you might click the button at any time.

ðŸŸ¨ Step 6: User Clicks the Button Later
Browser detects the click on #btn

It moves the registered callback cb() into the Callback Queue

The Event Loop checks:

"Is the Call Stack empty?"

âœ… Yes (we're idle now)

So it pushes cb() into the Call Stack

ðŸŸ¦ Step 7: Callback Executes

console.log("Callback");
Callback function runs inside call stack

ðŸ–¨ Output: Callback

ðŸ§  Summary of the Components
Component	Role
Call Stack	Executes synchronous code
Web API		Stores registered events & timers (e.g., addEventListener)
Callback Queue	Holds event callbacks (e.g., from click, timer) until ready to run
Event Loop	Moves callbacks from the queue to the stack when it's empty

ðŸ–¨ Final Output in Console:

Start
End
(Click happens later...)
Callback
