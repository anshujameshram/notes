In React, controlled and uncontrolled elements refer to how form data is managed.
✅ Controlled Components
React controls the value of the input through state.

You use useState (or this.state in class components).
The input’s value is always determined by React.
Example:
import { useState } from 'react';
function ControlledForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  return (
    <input type="text"value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}

🔍 Characteristics:
One-way data binding: React → Input
Easier to validate or manipulate input values
Better suited for form submissions or complex forms


🚫 Uncontrolled Components
The DOM controls the input value.
You access the value using a ref (reference to the DOM element).
React does not track changes to the value.

Example:
import { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };
  return (
    <><input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>  );
}
🔍 Characteristics:
Useful for simple forms or when integrating with non-React code
Harder to validate or keep in sync with app state

🆚 Summary Table:
Feature			Controlled			Uncontrolled
State management	React (useState)		DOM (useRef)
Value source		React state			DOM input value
Validation		Easier and inline with React	Manual via ref
Use case		Complex forms, validation	Simple inputs, quick scripts
 
Do you want to know when to use one over the other in a real-world scenario?
 
Derived State in React
-------------------------
Derived state refers to state that is computed from other state or props, rather than being directly stored and updated.

📌 Why Avoid Storing Derived State?
Storing derived values in state can lead to:
Inconsistency if not properly synced
Redundant updates and complexity
 
Derived state is not stored directly in React — instead, it is calculated from other data like props or state.

example- ageInMonths = age * 12

ex2-

function Welcome({ firstName, lastName }) {
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName; // this is derived state

  return <h1>Hello, {fullName}</h1>;
}


 Spread Operator (...)
💬 Purpose:
To spread or unpack values from an array or object — into a new array, object, or function arguments.

🔹 1. Spread in Arrays
📌 Example 1: Copying an array

const original = [1, 2, 3];
const copy = [...original];
console.log(copy); // [1, 2, 3]

➡ This creates a new array. It’s like cloning — changing copy won’t affect original.

📌 Example 2: Combining arrays

const a = [1, 2];
const b = [3, 4];

const combined = [...a, ...b];
console.log(combined); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

🔹 2. Spread in Objects
📌 Example: Copying and adding properties

const obj1 = { x: 10, y: 20 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, z: 30 };
console.log(obj2); // { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 }

✅ Use this to clone objects or merge multiple objects.

🔹 3. Spread in Function Calls
📌 Example:

const numbers = [5, 10, 15];
console.log(Math.max(...numbers)); // 15

✅ ...numbers breaks the array into individual arguments like Math.max(5, 10, 15)

⚠️ Caution: Spread creates a shallow copy, not deep

const obj = { a: 1, nested: { b: 2 } };
const copy = { ...obj };
copy.nested.b = 5;
console.log(obj.nested.b); // 5 (it changed!)

Use libraries like lodash or custom deep clone functions for nested structures.

🌀 Rest Operator (...)
💬 Purpose:
To gather multiple elements into an array or object — usually in function parameters or destructuring.

🔹 1. Rest in Functions (Variable arguments)
📌 Example:

function add(...nums) {
  return nums.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
}
console.log(add(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
✅ Here, ...nums collects all arguments into an array: [1, 2, 3, 4].

🔹 2. Rest in Array Destructuring
📌 Example:

const [first, ...others] = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(first);  // 10
console.log(others); // [20, 30, 40]

🔹 3. Rest in Object Destructuring
📌 Example:

const { name, ...rest } = { name: 'John', age: 25, city: 'Pune' };
console.log(name); // John
console.log(rest); // { age: 25, city: 'Pune' }

🧠 How to Tell the Difference?
Context						... acts as		Meaning
Right side (e.g. [...arr], {...obj})		Spread			Expands values
Function parameter (e.g. function(...args))	Rest			Collects values into array
Destructuring (e.g. const [a, ...b] = arr)	Rest			Captures remaining items


 
Operator		Position	Valid?	Example
Spread			Start		✅	[...arr, 4]
			Middle		✅	[1, ...arr, 4]
			End		✅	[1, 2, ...arr]
Rest			Start		❌	function(...args, last) ❌
			Middle		❌	function(a, ...rest, b) ❌
			End		✅	function(a, b, ...rest) ✅

🔹 var, let, and const: Overview
Feature				var			let			const
Scope				Function-scoped		Block-scoped ({})	Block-scoped ({})
Reassignable			✅ Yes			✅ Yes			❌ No (constant reference)
Redeclarable			✅ Yes			❌ No			❌ No
Hoisted				✅ Yes (initialized as undefined)	✅ Yes (but not initialized)	✅ Yes (but not initialized)
Temporal Dead Zone		❌ No			✅ Yes			✅ Yes


1. var – Function Scoped
js
Copy
Edit
function testVar() {
  if (true) {
    var a = 10;
  }
  console.log(a); // 10 (accessible outside the block)
}
testVar();
var is accessible outside the block it's defined in (inside the same function).

Redeclaring a var variable does not throw an error.

js
Copy
Edit
var x = 1;
var x = 2; // ✅ No error
✅ 2. let – Block Scoped
js
Copy
Edit
function testLet() {
  if (true) {
    let b = 20;
    console.log(b); // 20
  }
  // console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError: b is not defined
}
testLet();
let is not accessible outside the block {} it's declared in.

Redeclaring let in the same scope throws an error.

js
Copy
Edit
let y = 5;
// let y = 10; // ❌ SyntaxError
✅ 3. const – Block Scoped + Constant
js
Copy
Edit
const z = 30;
z = 40; // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
const cannot be reassigned.

But: for objects and arrays, their contents can still change.

js
Copy
Edit
const person = { name: "John" };
person.name = "Jane"; // ✅ Allowed


Hoisting-
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

var is hoisted (but value is undefined)

ex-
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

🔸 This behaves like:

var a;        // declaration hoisted
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;       // assignment happens here

let and const are hoisted too — BUT in Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 10;
Even though b is hoisted, it cannot be accessed before declaration — that's the TDZ.

Same with const:

console.log(c); // ❌ ReferenceError
const c = 20;


What is TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) in JavaScript?
Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the time between when a variable is hoisted and when it is actually declared (initialized) — during this time, accessing the variable results in a ReferenceError.

🔑 In Simple Words:
TDZ is the phase after a block starts but before the let or const variable is declared — where the variable exists, but cannot be accessed.

🔹 Example of TDZ:
{
  console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
  let a = 5;
}
The variable a is hoisted but not initialized.

So during the TDZ (from block start { to let a = 5), you can't access a.

🔹 Example with var (No TDZ):

{
  console.log(b); // ✅ undefined (no error)
  var b = 10;
}
var is hoisted and initialized to undefined, so there is no TDZ.

🔹 Real-world use case:

function greet() {
  if (true) {
    // TDZ starts here for `name`
    // console.log(name); // ❌ ReferenceError
    let name = "Alice"; // TDZ ends here
    console.log(name);  // ✅ Alice
  }
}
greet();
❗ Why does TDZ exist?
TDZ helps catch errors and enforce good coding practices. Without it:

You might read a variable before it's properly initialized.

It helps avoid unexpected undefined values like with var.

✅ Rule to Avoid TDZ:
Always declare variables (let / const) at the top of their block, before you use them.


strict mode-
Strict mode is a special mode in JavaScript that makes your code more secure, clean, and less error-prone by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling.

Why use "use strict"?
Strict mode:

Prevents accidental bugs
Disallows unsafe actions
Makes debugging easier


❌ Using undeclared variables

"use strict";
x = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError: x is not defined

Behavior				Without "use strict"		With "use strict"
🛑 Undeclared Variables			Allowed (automatic global)	❌ Throws an error
🛑 Duplicate Function Parameters	Allowed				❌ Throws an error
🛑 Assignment to Read-only Properties	Allowed				❌ Throws an error
🛑 this in Global Functions		Refers to global object (window)	this is undefined
🛑 Use of with Statement		Allowed				❌ Throws an error
🛑 Global eval Variables		Allowed				Creates new variables only inside eval()
🛑 Delete Variables		Allowed					❌ Throws an error


note-
It doesn’t apply automatically — you must write "use strict" explicitly.
Many modern tools like ES6 modules or TypeScript use strict mode by default.


 What Are Queues in JavaScript?
JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment — one thing happens at a time. So, to manage async operations (like setTimeout, promises, etc.), JavaScript uses queues and the event loop.

There are mainly two types of queues:

Macrotask Queue (a.k.a. Task Queue)
Microtask Queue (a.k.a. Job Queue)

The Event Loop
-------------------
The event loop is the mechanism that:

Picks one task from the Call Stack (main execution).
Executes all microtasks after that.
Then moves on to the next macrotask.
Repeats forever.

Macrotask → All Microtasks → Next Macrotask → All Microtasks → ...

1. Macrotask Queue / callback queue
Macrotasks include:

setTimeout()
setInterval()
setImmediate() (Node.js)
DOM Events
Ajax callbacks
UI rendering

🧪 Example:

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macrotask - setTimeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
🧾 Output:

Start
End
Macrotask - setTimeout

The setTimeout goes into the macrotask queue and runs after the current execution and all microtasks.

🔷 2. Microtask Queue
Microtasks include:

Promise.then(), catch(), finally()
queueMicrotask() (manual microtask)
MutationObserver (DOM change tracking)

🧪 Example:

console.log("Start");

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask - Promise");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macrotask - setTimeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
🧾 Output:

Start
End
Microtask - Promise
Macrotask - setTimeout

Even though setTimeout is set for 0ms, promises run first because microtasks run after every synchronous task before any macrotask.

🔄 Full Flow Example:

console.log("script start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("promise1");
}).then(() => {
  console.log("promise2");
});

console.log("script end");
🧾 Output:

script start
script end
promise1
promise2
setTimeout

🧠 Why?
script start & script end: synchronous
promise1 & promise2: microtasks
setTimeout: microtask

Summary
JavaScript uses task queues to handle async operations.
Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks.
After every macrotask, all microtasks are processed before the next macrotask.
Understanding this helps avoid unexpected behavior in asynchronous code.



what is event loop


ChatGPT said:
The event loop is the heart of JavaScript’s concurrency model. It allows JavaScript (which is single-threaded) to handle asynchronous operations like timers, user input, API calls, and promises without blocking the main thread.

🧠 In Simple Words:
The event loop continuously checks:

Is the call stack empty?

Are there tasks (macrotasks or microtasks) waiting to run?

If yes, it pushes the next task into the call stack for execution.

🔁 How the Event Loop Works (Step-by-Step):
🟢 Runs synchronous code (line-by-line).

🔵 Handles microtasks (e.g., .then(), queueMicrotask()).

🔴 Runs one macrotask (e.g., setTimeout, events).

🔁 Repeats steps 2–3 forever.

🧪 Example:
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Macrotask');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Microtask');
});

console.log('End');
🧾 Output:
Start

Microtask
Macrotask

✅ Why?
Start and End are synchronous.

Promise.then is a microtask → runs before setTimeout.

setTimeout is a macrotask → runs last.

🧠 Why Is the Event Loop Important?
Makes non-blocking I/O possible.

Helps UI stay responsive in the browser.

Enables features like async/await, Promises, and setTimeout.


Curring-
---------

Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions,
 each taking a single argument.

ex-

Instead of:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
You curry it like:

function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}
Now you can use it like:

const add5 = add(5);  // returns a function
console.log(add5(3)); // 8

✅ Why Use Currying?
Reusability: Create specialized functions easily.
Readability: Express logic more clearly.
Function Composition: Works well with other functional techniques.

ex-
Original Function

function multiply(a, b, c) {
  return a * b * c;
}

Curried Version

function curriedMultiply(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return function(c) {
      return a * b * c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(curriedMultiply(2)(3)(4)); // 24

ex-
Currying with ES6 Arrow Functions

const curriedMultiply = a => b => c => a * b * c;

console.log(curriedMultiply(2)(3)(4)); // 24


Concept		Meaning
Currying	Transform a function of n arguments → n functions of 1 arg each
Syntax		f(a)(b)(c) instead of f(a, b, c)
Benefits	Reusability, clarity, functional chaining


ex-
Currying vs Partial Application
Currying: Breaks function into a chain of 1-arg functions.

Partial Application: Fixes some arguments of a function and returns a new function.

// Partial Application
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10


ex-
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

function curry(fn) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= fn.length) {
      return fn.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      return function(...nextArgs) {
        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(nextArgs));
      };
    }
  };
}

const curriedSum = curry(sum);

You pass sum into curry.
curry returns a new function (curriedSum) that allows you to pass arguments one-by-one (or in groups).

console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(3));     // 6
console.log(curriedSum(1, 2)(3));     // 6
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2, 3));     // 6

High order function-
---------------------
A Higher-Order Function (HOF) is a function that either:
Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
Returns a function as its result
👉 In short, functions that work with other functions.

Why are they useful?
JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens — you can pass them around like values (variables, parameters, return values).
This makes HOFs possible and very powerful for abstraction, composition, and reusability.

Examples of Higher-Order Functions
1. setTimeout (takes a function as an argument)
js
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('This is delayed');
}, 1000);
Here, setTimeout is a higher-order function — it takes a function as an argument.

2. Array.map() (takes a function)
js
Copy
Edit
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
map() is a higher-order function.

It takes a callback function to apply to each element.

3. Returning a function
js
Copy
Edit
function greet(name) {
  return function(message) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}. ${message}`);
  };
}

const greetJohn = greet("John");
greetJohn("Welcome!"); // Hello, John. Welcome!
greet() returns a function → so it’s a higher-order function.

4. Creating custom higher-order functions
js
Copy
Edit
function repeat(operation, times) {
  for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
    operation();
  }
}

repeat(() => console.log("Doing task..."), 3);
repeat takes a function as input and runs it times times.

Feature				 Description
Takes function as argument	 map, filter, reduce, setTimeout, etc.
Returns a function		 Currying, partial application, factory funcs
Combines or transforms behavior	 Great for abstraction and reusability

what is factory functions?
A Factory Function is a function that returns a new object (or function) each time it’s called — like a factory producing a new product.
It’s a design pattern used to create multiple similar objects without using classes or constructors.


ex-

function createUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name,
    age,
    greet() {
      console.log(`Hi, I'm ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
    }
  };
}

const user1 = createUser('Alice', 25);
const user2 = createUser('Bob', 30);

user1.greet(); // Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 25 years old.
user2.greet(); // Hi, I'm Bob and I'm 30 years old.

 Here, createUser is a factory function because it returns a new user object each time it's called.

 Why Use Factory Functions?
Simpler than using class or new
Easy to customize objects
Great for code reusability and organization
Can create private variables using closures

Example 2: Factory Function with Closure (private data)
function secretHolder(secret) {
  return {
    getSecret() {
      return secret;
    }
  };
}

const obj = secretHolder('myPassword123');
console.log(obj.getSecret()); // 'myPassword123'
// `secret` is private — cannot access it directly

 The secret variable is private — it’s only accessible via the returned function (getSecret), thanks to closures.


Summary
Factory Function: A function that returns a new object or function.
Used to create multiple similar objects without classes or constructors.
Works well with closures, functional patterns, and clean code practices.

 Factory Function vs Constructor Function vs Class
Feature	Factory 			Function		Constructor (new)		Class
Returns					Any object		this by default			this
Uses new keyword			❌ No			✅ Yes				✅ Yes
Can return custom types			✅ Yes			❌ Limited			❌ Limited
Uses closure for private data		✅ Yes			❌ No				❌ (without tricks)


closures-
When a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function uses variables from the outer function — that's a closure.
Even after the outer function is done running, the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables.

A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer (lexical) scope, even after that scope has finished executing.

ex-

function outer() {
  const outerVar = "I am from outer!";

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // inner uses variable from outer
  }

  return inner;
}

const fn = outer(); // outer() runs and returns inner()
fn(); // logs: "I am from outer!"

inner() closes over the variable outerVar.
Even though outer() has finished executing, inner() still remembers outerVar — that’s a closure.

Real-World Analogy
Think of a closure like a backpack 🎒.
When a function is created, it carries a backpack that holds all the variables from where it was created.
Even if it's used somewhere else later, it still has access to those variables in its backpack.

Use Cases of Closures
1. Data Privacy / Encapsulation

function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter1 = createCounter();
console.log(counter1()); // 1
console.log(counter1()); // 2

const counter2 = createCounter();
console.log(counter2()); // 1
count is private — it’s accessible only to the returned function.

2. Partial Application

function multiply(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x * y;
  };
}

const double = multiply(2); // x = 2
console.log(double(5));     // 10
The inner function remembers x = 2 — that's closure in action.

3. Callbacks and Asynchronous Code

function delayedGreeting(name) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  }, 1000);
}

delayedGreeting("Alice");
Even though setTimeout runs after 1 second, the inner arrow function still has access to name due to closure.

Concept				Explanation
Closure				Inner function remembers variables from outer scope
Scope				Created at the time function is defined
Use Cases			Data hiding, factory functions, async logic




call() ,apply() and bind() method-
------------------------------
All three methods are used to manipulate the value of this inside a function.

call()
------
Calls a function immediately, with a given this and arguments passed individually.

function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
}

const person = { name: "Alice" };

greet.call(person, "Hello", "!"); // Hello, Alice!
this → refers to person

"Hello" and "!" are passed as individual arguments

🔹 apply()
-----------
Same as call(), but arguments are passed as an array.

greet.apply(person, ["Hi", "."]); // Hi, Alice.
Useful when you already have arguments in an array

🔹 bind()
----------
Does NOT call the function immediately.
Instead, it returns a new function with this permanently bound.

const greetAlice = greet.bind(person, "Hey");
greetAlice("?"); // Hey, Alice?
bind() is great for later use or callbacks.

ex-
const user = { name: "Bob" };

function say(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
}

// call
say.call(user, "Hello"); // Hello, Bob

// apply
say.apply(user, ["Hi"]); // Hi, Bob

// bind
const sayHiToBob = say.bind(user, "Hey");
sayHiToBob(); // Hey, Bob

Summary Table
Method	Calls the Function?		this Set To	Arguments Passed As
call()	✅ Immediately			First argument	Individually: arg1, arg2
apply()	✅ Immediately			First argument	Array: [arg1, arg2]
bind()	❌ Returns a new function	First argument	Can be pre-set or passed later

When to Use?
Use Case				Method
Immediate function call			call() / apply()
Pre-binding a function for later use	bind()
Arguments already in an array		apply()

first class function-
In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.

This means functions can be:

Stored in variables
Passed as arguments to other functions
Returned from functions
Assigned to object properties (Store them in data structures (like arrays, objects))

ex-
// Assigned to a variable
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello");
};

// Passed as an argument
function callFn(fn) {
  fn(); // "Hello"
}
callFn(greet);

// Returned from a function
function outer() {
  return function() {
    console.log("I'm inner");
  };
}
const inner = outer();
inner(); // "I'm inner"

*Storing functions in an object or array---

const operations = {
  add: function(a, b) { return a + b; },
  subtract: function(a, b) { return a - b; }
};

console.log(operations.add(10, 5)); // Output: 15

const funcs = [
  () => console.log("First"),
  () => console.log("Second")

✅ Functions can be stored inside arrays and objects just like values.


Higher-Order Functions (HOF)-
A Higher-Order Function is a function that either:

Takes one or more functions as arguments, OR

Returns a function.

// 1. Takes function as argument
function repeat(n, action) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    action(i);
  }
}
repeat(3, console.log); // logs 0 1 2

// 2. Returns a function
function multiplier(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x * y;
  };
}
const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

So functions like map, filter, reduce are HOFs.

Why are map, filter, and reduce considered Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)?
Because:

❗️They take other functions as arguments — specifically, callback functions.

🔍 Let's break it down:
🔹 map()
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); 
// `map` takes a function `(num => num * 2)` as input


🔹 filter()
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
// `filter` takes a function that returns true or false


🔹 reduce()
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
// `reduce` takes a reducer function as its first argument

✅ Summary Reason:
map, filter, and reduce are higher-order functions because they operate on other functions by accepting them as arguments, which is exactly what a higher-order function is defined to do.

What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?
A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

It’s like a wrapper that adds extra functionality or behavior to an existing component without modifying the original one.

📘 Syntax:
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderFunction(WrappedComponent);

✅ Simple Example:
🎯 Goal: Add logging when a component mounts.

function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {
    console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} is rendering`);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
🧩 Usage:

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const HelloWithLogger = withLogger(Hello);

// In App.js
<HelloWithLogger name="Alice" />

🖨️ Console Output:

Component Hello is rendering

🧠 Key Points:
Concept					Description
Takes a component			withLogger(Hello)
Returns a new component			EnhancedComponent with extra logic
Does not mutate original		It wraps it and adds behavior, doesn’t change Hello itself
Passes props through			Always use {...props} to maintain original functionality

🛠 Real-World Use Cases for HOCs
Use Case			Example Function
Add logging			withLogger(Component)
Inject authentication		withAuth(Component)
Handle loading/spinner		withLoader(Component)
Reuse form logic		withFormValidation(Component)
Add theming or styling		withTheme(Component)

⚠️ Caveats of HOCs
Can cause wrapper hell (deep nesting)
Harder to trace in DevTools
Be careful with ref forwarding
Better suited for logic reuse—now mostly replaced by custom hooks in modern React ---

🚀 HOC vs Hook
Feature				HOC				Hook
Based on			Component wrappers		Function logic
Reuse logic in			Class or function components	Function components only
Preferred in modern React	❌ Less preferred		✅ Preferred way now

ex2-
function withUppercase(WrappedComponent) {
  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {
    const uppercasedName = props.name.toUpperCase();
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} name={uppercasedName} />;
  };
}

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h2>Hello, {name}</h2>;
}

const LoudGreeting = withUppercase(Greeting);

// <LoudGreeting name="bob" /> => "Hello, BOB"

What is a Callback Function?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed later, usually after some operation or event.

It allows asynchronous or deferred execution of code.

🧠 Think of it like this:
You ask a friend (a function) to call you (your callback function) once they’re done with a task. That’s a callback.

🧪 Basic Example

function greetUser(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback(); // <-- this is the callback function
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greetUser("Alice", sayBye);
🖨️ Output:
Hello Alice
Goodbye!

🔁 Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you're baking a cake:


function bakeCake(callback) {
  console.log("Baking the cake...");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Cake is ready!");
    callback(); // Notify when cake is ready
  }, 2000);
}

function serveCake() {
  console.log("Serving the cake.");
}

bakeCake(serveCake);

🖨️ Output after 2 seconds:

Baking the cake...
Cake is ready!
Serving the cake.

📚 Where are Callbacks used?
1. Array methods like map, filter, forEach use callbacks:

[1, 2, 3].forEach(function (num) {
  console.log(num * 2);
});

2. Event Handling:

button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

3. Asynchronous APIs:

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Executed after 1 second");
}, 1000);

🚫 Callback Hell
When callbacks are nested deeply, it becomes messy and hard to maintain:

doTask1(function () {
  doTask2(function () {
    doTask3(function () {
      console.log("All tasks done");
    });
  });
});
✅ Solution: Use Promises or async/await.

✅ Summary
Feature						Description
What is it?					A function passed into another function as an argument
When used?					After some task/event completes
Used in						setTimeout, event listeners, APIs, map, filter, etc.
Problems					Callback hell in deeply nested logic
Solution					Promises and async/await


What is a Promise?
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

Syntax:

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async task
});

✅ States of a Promise:
State		Meaning
pending		Initial state, not fulfilled/rejected
fulfilled	Operation completed successfully
rejected	Operation failed

🧪 Example:

const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data received!");
      // Or reject("Failed to fetch data");
    }, 2000);
  });
};

fetchData()
  .then((data) => console.log(data))     // ✅ success
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));   // ❌ failure

Output after 2 seconds:

Data received!

🔹 2. Why use Promises?
They solve the problem of callback hell, by making async code cleaner and more readable.

🔹 3. What is async/await?
async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises that lets you write asynchronous code like it's synchronous.

🧪 Example with async/await:


const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Fetched with async/await!");
    }, 2000);
  });
};

async function getData() {
  try {
    const result = await fetchData();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

getData();
Output after 2 seconds:

Fetched with async/await!

✅ Comparison: .then() vs async/await
With .then():

fetchData().then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});

With async/await:

const data = await fetchData();
console.log(data);

✅ Summary Table

Feature			Promise				async/await
Syntax style		Chained with .then()		Looks like synchronous code
Error handling		.catch()			try...catch block
Cleaner code		❌ Can be messy with nesting	✅ Very clean and readable
Return value		Promise object			Actual resolved value

What is fetch()?
fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handle responses — typically used to fetch data from APIs.
It returns a Promise.

fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: "My Post",
    body: "Post content",
    userId: 1,
  }),
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log("Created:", data))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));

 Using fetch() with async/await (cleaner)

async function getPost() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Fetch error:", error);
  }
}

getPost();

Common Options in fetch()
Option	Description
method	HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
headers	Headers to send (e.g., Content-Type)
body	Data to send (usually JSON for POST/PUT)
mode	CORS, no-cors, same-origin

fetch() does not reject on HTTP errors (like 404). You must check response.ok.

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error("Network response was not OK");
}

async and defer attribute-
----------------------------

The async and defer attributes are used in the <script> tag in HTML to control how JavaScript files are loaded and executed. They are particularly useful for improving page load performance by preventing scripts from blocking HTML parsing.

1. async Attribute
When to use: For scripts that do not depend on any other scripts or DOM elements (e.g., analytics).

Behavior:

Script is fetched asynchronously.
Script is executed as soon as it is downloaded, without waiting for the HTML to finish parsing.
Can cause issues if the script relies on DOM elements that haven’t loaded yet.

<script src="script.js" async></script>

2. defer Attribute
When to use: For scripts that depend on the DOM being fully parsed but not necessarily on other scripts.

Behavior:

Script is fetched asynchronously.
Script is executed only after the HTML has been completely parsed.
Maintains execution order for multiple scripts with defer.

<script src="script.js" defer></script>

Recommendation:
Use defer for scripts that manipulate the DOM or depend on other scripts.
Use async for independent scripts like analytics or ads.


Debouncing and throttling are performance optimization techniques used to limit how often a function is executed, especially for high-frequency events like scroll, resize, keypress, or input.

🔁 Debouncing
-------------------
✅ What it does:
Delays the function call until after a specified "quiet" period has passed since the last time the event was triggered.

📌 Use Case:
Search input where API calls are made only after the user stops typing.
Resize or window scroll where you only want to react after the user stops resizing or scrolling.

⏱ Behavior:
Only the last function call is executed after the delay.

📦 Example in JavaScript:

function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Usage
window.addEventListener('resize', debounce(() => {
  console.log('Resized!');
}, 300));

🕒 Throttling
------------------
✅ What it does:
Ensures a function is called at most once in a specified time interval, no matter how many times the event is triggered.

📌 Use Case:
Scroll or mousemove events where you want regular updates (like loading content or updating position), but not too frequently.
Button click handlers to prevent spamming.

⏱ Behavior:
Executes the function at regular intervals, ignoring repeated calls during the wait.

📦 Example in JavaScript:

function throttle(fn, interval) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function(...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

// Usage

window.addEventListener('scroll', throttle(() => {
  console.log('Scroll event');
}, 200));

🔍 Key Difference
Feature			Debounce				Throttle
Timing			Executes after delay (last event)	Executes at intervals
Use case		Wait until user stops doing action	Limit function to once per X ms
Execution style		Only the final call is triggered	First call + regular intervals



children props in react-
--------------------------
const Card = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>Title</h2>
      <p>This is some content inside the card!</p>
    </Card>
  );
};

In the Card component, props.children represents whatever is placed inside <Card>...</Card>.
children prop	A special prop that holds nested JSX

How children works:
React automatically assigns any nested JSX to the children prop.

It can be:

A single element
Multiple elements
Text
A function (in some advanced use cases)

Why use children?

It helps in:
Creating layout or wrapper components.
Reusing component structures.
Composing UIs dynamically.


What is a Polyfill?
A polyfill is like a backup plan.
Some old browsers don’t understand new JavaScript features. So, we write our own version of that feature — that's called a polyfill.
Think of it like this:
If your browser doesn’t know how to do something, we teach it using a polyfill.

What is .bind()?
The .bind() method is used to lock the value of this inside a function.

const person = {
  name: "Sam"
};

function sayName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const saySam = sayName.bind(person);
saySam(); // It prints "Sam"

✅ bind() makes sure that this inside sayName always refers to the person object.

Simple Polyfill for .bind()
---------------------------
Now imagine old browsers don’t understand .bind().
We create our own version like this:

if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
  Function.prototype.bind = function(context, ...args) {
    const fn = this;
    return function(...newArgs) {
      return fn.apply(context, args.concat(newArgs));
    };
  };
}


🧾 Simple Explanation of the Above Polyfill:
Check if bind exists:
If not, we define it.

Inside the custom bind:

context → the object we want this to refer to.
args → any arguments we give in advance.
fn = this → the original function we're binding.
We return a new function that:
Combines old + new arguments.
Calls the original function using fn.apply.

Example Using the Polyfill

function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(greeting + " " + this.name + punctuation);
}

const user = { name: "Alice" };

const greetUser = greet.bind(user, "Hi");
greetUser("!"); // Output: Hi Alice!
➡️ Even if your browser didn't know bind(), with the polyfill, it will behave the same way!

✅ In Short:
Polyfill = Backup code to support older browsers.
.bind() = Locks this to a specific object.
Polyfill for bind = We create a version of .bind() if it's not already available.




What is Prop Drilling in React?
📌 Definition:
Prop Drilling is the process of passing data (props) from a parent component down to deeply nested child components through intermediate components — even if those intermediate components don't use the data.

🔧 Example of Prop Drilling
jsx
Copy
Edit
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import Parent from './Parent';

function App() {
  return <Parent username="John" />;
}

export default App;
jsx
Copy
Edit
// Parent.js
import React from 'react';
import Child from './Child';

const Parent = ({ username }) => {
  return <Child username={username} />;
};

export default Parent;
jsx
Copy
Edit
// Child.js
import React from 'react';

const Child = ({ username }) => {
  return <p>Hello, {username}!</p>;
};

export default Child;
❌ Problem:
Here, the username prop is passed through Parent even though Parent doesn’t use it. This becomes hard to manage as the component tree grows.

✅ Solution:
Use Context API or state management tools (like Redux) to avoid prop drilling.


Why does useState not reflect the updated value immediately?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
When you update a state using useState, the updated value is not available immediately in the next line.

This is because:

State updates in React are asynchronous and batched for performance.

🔍 Example
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

function handleClick() {
  setCount(count + 1);
  console.log(count); // ❌ Still prints the old value
}
Here, setCount(count + 1) schedules a state update, but it doesn’t update count right away. So console.log(count) still shows the old value.

🔄 What's really happening?
setCount(count + 1) tells React: “Hey, I want to update count.”

React schedules the update to run after the current render finishes.

On the next render, count will have the new value.

✅ How to get the updated value correctly?
1. Use useEffect to react to state changes:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Updated count:", count);
}, [count]);

This runs after the count state is updated and the component is re-rendered.

2. Or use a function to update state:

setCount(prevCount => {
  console.log("Previous count:", prevCount); // ✅ Correct value
  return prevCount + 1;
});
Using the function form of setCount() gives you the latest state.

🧠 Summary
❓ Question						✅ Answer
Why doesn't updated state reflect immediately?		Because useState updates are asynchronous and batched
How to see updated state?				Use useEffect() or setState(prev => ...)
Does console.log() immediately after setCount() work?	❌ No, it logs the old value



Custom hooks-
---------------
custom hooks- is about the reuasability.
is use to reuse stateful logic among multiple components. any logic that can one or more hooks which is non visual logic .

A custom hook is simply a JavaScript function whose name starts with "use" and which can call other hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.).

📌 Purpose: To reuse logic across multiple components without duplicating code.

It’s a way to extract and share logic that would otherwise be repeated across components.

💡 Why Use Custom Hooks?
To remove duplicated logic

To make code cleaner and more modular

To make component files easier to read

To share behavior like fetching data, form handling, timers, etc.

✅ Basic Example: useCounter Custom Hook
Step 1: Create the custom hook

// useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';

function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
}

export default useCounter;

Step 2: Use it in a component

// CounterComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import useCounter from './useCounter';

function CounterComponent() {
  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter(5); // start at 5

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={increment}>➕ Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>➖ Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>🔁 Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
🔄 Another Real-World Example: useFetch for API Calls

Step 1: Create the hook

// useFetch.js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const res = await fetch(url);
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Network error");
        const json = await res.json();
        setData(json);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

export default useFetch;

Step 2: Use it in a component

// UserList.js
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from './useFetch';

function UserList() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');

  if (loading) return <p>Loading users...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name} ({user.email})</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
📌 Rules for Custom Hooks
Name must start with use (e.g., useCounter, useForm)

You can use other hooks inside a custom hook

You must follow the Rules of Hooks:

Only call hooks at the top level (not inside conditions or loops)

Only call hooks inside function components or other custom hooks

🧠 Summary
Feature	Description
🔁 Reusable Logic	Encapsulate common code into functions
📦 Cleaner Components	Keeps components focused on rendering
⚙️ Hook Friendly	Can use useState, useEffect, etc.




What is Batching in React?
Batching means that multiple state updates are grouped together into a single re-render, instead of triggering a re-render for each individual state change.

✅ Why Batching?
Improves performance.
Prevents unnecessary renders.

Advanced Concepts
1. Stopping Propagation

event.stopPropagation(); // Prevent event bubbling

2. Preventing Default Behavior

event.preventDefault(); // Stop form submission, link redirect, etc.


Why Use preventDefault()?
Many browser events have a default behavior. If you want to override or stop that behavior, you use preventDefault().

1. 📝 Prevent Form Submission

function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent page reload
  console.log("Form submitted!");
}

return (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
);

 Default behavior:
Browser reloads or navigates to another page on submit.

After preventDefault():
You handle the form submission logic yourself, such as validation or API calls.


2. Prevent Link Navigation


function handleClick(e) {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent link from navigating
  alert("Link clicked, but not navigating!");
}

return <a href="https://google.com" onClick={handleClick}>Google</a>;



 Important Notes
In React, e is a SyntheticEvent, not a native DOM event.

You still call e.preventDefault() exactly the same way.

It works identically across all browsers thanks to React's event system.

 When Should You Use It?

| Use Case                        | Use `preventDefault()`?  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Prevent form page reload        | ✅ Yes                    |
| Prevent link navigation         | ✅ Yes                    |
| Block drag-and-drop behavior    | ✅ Yes                    |
| Custom right-click context menu | ✅ Yes (on `contextmenu`) |
| Button click                    | ❌ Usually not needed     |


| Method              | Purpose                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `preventDefault()`  | Prevent browser’s default action |
| `stopPropagation()` | Stop event from bubbling up      |


what happen if i define multiple useEffect hooks in react in 1 compoenent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Happens If You Use Multiple useEffects?
➤ All useEffect hooks will run independently.
They are executed in the order they are defined.

Each useEffect hook can have:

its own logic
its own dependency array
its own cleanup

💡 Why Use Multiple useEffect Hooks?
✅ For separation of concerns.
Example:


useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Fetching data...");
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Setting up event listener...");
  return () => console.log("Cleaning up event listener");
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Listening to props change:", someProp);
}, [someProp]);

🧠 This is better than:

useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch data
  // Set up event listeners
  // Watch props
}, []);
Splitting them makes code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

🔄 Execution Order
If you write:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Effect 1');
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Effect 2');
}, []);

You will see:

Effect 1
Effect 2
And on unmount, cleanup runs in reverse order:

Cleanup of Effect 2
Cleanup of Effect 1


 Important Rules
useEffect should always be called at the top level (not conditionally).
Order of definition matters for cleanup.
Each useEffect must return either nothing or a cleanup function.


| Feature                | Behavior                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Multiple `useEffect`s? | ✅ Allowed                      |
| Execution order        | 🔼 Top to bottom               |
| Cleanup order          | 🔽 Bottom to top               |
| Purpose                | Logical separation of concerns |
