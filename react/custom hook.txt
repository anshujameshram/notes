if a function is not starting from use and does not contain any hooks then can it be a custom hook?


No, if a function does not start with use and does not use any React hooks internally, then it is not a custom hook.

üîç What is a Custom Hook in React?
A custom hook in React is:

A JavaScript function that starts with use

It calls other hooks internally (like useState, useEffect, etc.)

It follows the Rules of Hooks (e.g., only call hooks at the top level, not conditionally)


 Valid Custom Hook Example:
----------------------------
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  return [count, () => setCount(count + 1)];
}

‚ùå Not a Custom Hook:

function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
It doesn‚Äôt start with use

It doesn‚Äôt use any React hooks

So, it's just a regular utility function.


‚úÖ Conclusion:
To be considered a custom hook:

The function must start with use

It must use at least one React hook inside

If it fails either of these, it's not a custom hook ‚Äî just a regular JavaScript function.
