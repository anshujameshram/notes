1. Component
A component is a reusable piece of UI defined as a JavaScript function or class.

Function Component (preferred way):


function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

Class Component (older style):


class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
üîπ Think of a component as a template or blueprint.


2. Element
A React element is an object that describes what you want to see on the screen. It's what gets returned from a component (using JSX).

Example:


const element = <Greeting name="John" />;
React converts this JSX into something like:


{
  type: Greeting,
  props: { name: 'John' },
}
üîπ Elements are lightweight, immutable descriptions of what to render.



3. Instance
An instance is the rendered version of a component, maintained by React internally during the rendering process.

For class components, it‚Äôs the actual instance of the class (new Greeting()).

For function components, React internally tracks the "instance-like" state using hooks (though you don‚Äôt get an actual instance object).

You rarely deal directly with "instances" in function components, but they are part of React's internal lifecycle.

üîπ An instance represents the live version of a component that React has rendered and is tracking.

| Term      | What it is                            | Example                          | Analogy                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Component | A blueprint/template (function/class) | `function Greeting(props) {...}` | Like a class in OOP             |
| Element   | A description of a component          | `<Greeting name="John" />`       | Like an object creation         |
| Instance  | The live, working version in the UI   | Internally managed by React      | Like a real-time object running |


It's what React uses internally to:

Track state and props
Manage the component's lifecycle (e.g., mounting, updating, unmounting)
Connect to the DOM or virtual DOM




Class Components
-----------------------
For class components, the "instance" is very clear ‚Äî it's the actual object created using the new keyword:


class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Mounted");
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello</div>;
  }
}
When React renders <MyComponent />, it creates an instance like:


const instance = new MyComponent(props);
You can think of this as a traditional object in OOP, which has its own properties and lifecycle methods.



Function Components
-------------------------
For function components, there is no actual instance object created by new. Instead, React uses an internal structure to keep track of things like:

Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect)
Render output
Effects queue



ex-
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button>{count}</button>;
}



Even though there's no "instance" you can touch, React still creates and tracks a structure behind the scenes to manage this component‚Äôs behavior.



Why does "instance" matter?
------------------------------
React needs to remember each component on the screen: what props it had, what state it's in, etc.
React stores this info in the instance (class) or in a "fiber node" (function).
When re-rendering, React compares the current instance/fiber with the next one to decide what to update.


| Component Type     | Instance Exists? | Description                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Class Component    | ‚úÖ Yes            | Object created from class        |
| Function Component | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not directly  | Internally tracked using "fiber" |
